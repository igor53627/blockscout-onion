# Comparison with Other Solutions

This document compares our Docker Compose setup with other tools and approaches for running Tor hidden services.

## OnionSpray

[OnionSpray](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/onion-services/onionspray) is an official Tor Project tool designed for production-grade hidden service deployments. It's a comprehensive Python-based framework that handles complex scenarios like load balancing across multiple backend servers, managing multiple hidden services simultaneously, and sophisticated traffic routing. OnionSpray is ideal for organizations running large-scale infrastructure where reliability and redundancy are critical.

For simpler use cases where you need to expose a single HTTP service via Tor, this Docker Compose setup provides a more lightweight and maintainable alternative.

### Feature Comparison

| Feature | This Setup | OnionSpray |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| **Complexity** | Simple Docker Compose | Comprehensive framework |
| **Dependencies** | Docker only | Python, additional tools |
| **Use Case** | Single service proxying | Multiple services, load balancing |
| **Setup Time** | < 5 minutes | Longer configuration |
| **Customization** | Direct file editing | Configuration system |
| **Best For** | Quick deployments, single services | Enterprise, multi-service setups |
| **Learning Curve** | Low (basic Docker knowledge) | Medium (Python, config files) |
| **Load Balancing** | No (single backend) | Yes (multiple backends) |
| **High Availability** | Manual (restart on failure) | Built-in redundancy |
| **Monitoring** | Docker logs, manual | Advanced monitoring options |
| **Updates** | Manual rebuild | Package management |

### When to Use This Setup

Choose this Docker Compose approach when you:
- Want a simple, maintainable solution
- Need to expose a single HTTP service
- Prefer direct control over configuration
- Want minimal dependencies (just Docker)
- Need quick deployment (< 5 minutes)
- Are comfortable with Docker and basic networking
- Don't require load balancing or HA features

### When to Use OnionSpray

Choose OnionSpray when you:
- Need load balancing across multiple backends
- Require high availability and redundancy
- Manage multiple hidden services at scale
- Need sophisticated traffic routing
- Have enterprise infrastructure requirements
- Want automated failover and health checks
- Require centralized configuration management
- Have a dedicated operations team

## Other Approaches

### Native Tor Installation (No Containers)

Running Tor directly on the host system without containers.

**Pros**:
- Lower overhead (no containerization)
- Direct system integration
- Potentially better performance
- Simpler networking (no Docker networks)

**Cons**:
- System-wide installation (harder to isolate)
- Manual dependency management
- Harder to reproduce across environments
- More difficult to clean up
- OS-specific configuration

**Best for**: Legacy systems, minimal resource environments

### Kubernetes with Tor Sidecar

Running Tor as a sidecar container in Kubernetes pods.

**Pros**:
- Native Kubernetes integration
- Automatic scaling and orchestration
- Cloud-native deployment
- Advanced networking features

**Cons**:
- Requires Kubernetes cluster
- More complex setup
- Higher resource requirements
- Steeper learning curve

**Best for**: Cloud-native deployments, microservices architectures

### All-in-One Container

Single container running both Tor and the web service.

**Pros**:
- Simplest deployment (one container)
- Minimal resource usage
- Fastest startup

**Cons**:
- Poor separation of concerns
- Harder to debug
- Less flexible
- Difficult to scale components independently

**Best for**: Proof of concepts, minimal deployments

## Comparison Matrix

| Approach | Complexity | Flexibility | Isolation | Production-Ready |
|----------|------------|-------------|-----------|------------------|
| **This Setup** | Low | Medium | High | Yes |
| **OnionSpray** | Medium | High | High | Yes |
| **Native Tor** | Low | Low | Low | Medium |
| **Kubernetes** | High | High | High | Yes |
| **All-in-One** | Very Low | Low | Low | No |

## Migration Paths

### From This Setup to OnionSpray

If you outgrow this simple setup:

1. Export your `.onion` keys (see [BACKUP.md](BACKUP.md))
2. Install OnionSpray dependencies
3. Configure OnionSpray with your keys
4. Set up load balancing to multiple backends
5. Test thoroughly before switching

### From Native Tor to This Setup

Migrating from native Tor installation:

1. Backup your existing keys from `/var/lib/tor/hidden_service/`
2. Copy keys to `tor_data/hidden_service/`
3. Stop native Tor service
4. Start this Docker Compose setup
5. Verify same .onion address is active

## Performance Considerations

### Resource Usage

Approximate resource usage (idle state):

| Setup | CPU | Memory | Disk |
|-------|-----|--------|------|
| This Setup | ~5% | ~100MB | ~500MB |
| OnionSpray | ~10% | ~200MB | ~1GB |
| Native Tor | ~3% | ~50MB | ~200MB |
| Kubernetes | ~20% | ~500MB | ~2GB |

**Note**: Actual usage varies based on traffic and configuration.

### Latency

With single-hop mode enabled (as in this setup):

- **This Setup**: ~200-500ms (3+1 hops)
- **OnionSpray**: ~200-500ms (if configured similarly)
- **Native Tor**: ~200-500ms (if configured similarly)
- **Standard Tor** (6 hops): ~800-1500ms

## Security Trade-offs

### This Setup

- ✅ Container isolation
- ✅ No exit node functionality
- ✅ Minimal attack surface
- ⚠️ Single-hop mode (IP may be exposed)
- ⚠️ No built-in DDoS protection

### OnionSpray

- ✅ Production-grade security
- ✅ Multiple backend isolation
- ✅ Advanced monitoring
- ✅ Can run in full anonymity mode
- ⚠️ More complex = more potential misconfigurations

## Conclusion

**Choose this Docker Compose setup** if you value simplicity, quick deployment, and direct control over configuration.

**Choose OnionSpray** if you need enterprise features like load balancing, high availability, and advanced monitoring.

**Choose native Tor** if you have minimal resources or specific system integration requirements.

**Choose Kubernetes** if you're already in a cloud-native environment and need orchestration.

For most small to medium deployments exposing a single HTTP service, **this Docker Compose approach offers the best balance** of simplicity, maintainability, and production-readiness.
